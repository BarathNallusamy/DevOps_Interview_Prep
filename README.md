# DevOps interview questions

**What are the key benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them**

- ##### Ease of use

    Automated tests assists to increase the quality, With a single team working in collaboration with cross-functional members, DevOps organizations can deliver with maximum speed, functionality, and innovation.
- ##### Robustness
    
    Continuous software delivery ensures the software is built incrementely and higher in quality.
- ##### Cost

    Less prone to production failure and also the time is saved by deploying smaller working software.
- ##### Flexibility

    Diverse team members ensures faster resolution for problems. CI/CD approach changes are adopted quickly.

**What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud (use cases)**

- ##### Public cloud
    Public clouds are the most common type of cloud computing deployment, Simply like a **Pay as you go**. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud service provider. **AWS,Microsoft Azure** is an example of a public cloud.

    In a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage and network devices with other organisations or cloud “tenants”, and you access services and manage your account using a web browser. Public cloud deployments are frequently used to provide web-based email, online office applications, storage, and testing and development environments.

    Advantages of public clouds:

    - Lower costs – no need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use.
    - No maintenance – your service provider provides the maintenance.
    - Near-unlimited scalability – on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
    - High reliability – a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

- ##### Private cloud
  
    A private cloud consists of cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organisation. The private cloud can be physically located at your organisation’s on-site data centre, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organisation.

    In this way, a private cloud can make it easier for an organisation to customise its resources to meet specific IT requirements. Private clouds are often used by **government agencies, financial institutions** and any other medium to large-sized organisations with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.

    Advantages of a private cloud:

    - More flexibility – your organisation can customise its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
    - More control – resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible.
    - More scalability – private clouds often offer more scalability compared to on-premises infrastructure.

- ##### Hybrid cloud
  
    A hybrid cloud platform gives organisations many advantages such as greater flexibility, more deployment options, security, compliance and getting more value from their existing infrastructure. When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle any overflow – without giving third-party data centres access to the entirety of their data.

    Advantages of the hybrid cloud:

    - Control – your organisation can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency.
    - Flexibility – you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
    - Cost-effectiveness – with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
    - Ease – transitioning to the cloud doesn’t have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually – phasing in workloads over time.
